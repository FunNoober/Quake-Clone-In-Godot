# Quake-Clone-In-Godot
<p>Me experimenting with Quake like movement and weapons in the Godot Engine.</p>
<p>This is not designed to be a rip-off of the Quake games in any way. It is simply an experiment to see how well Godot is at handling Quake-Like games.</p>

## Important
<p>I will change the name of this little arcade shooter once the game starts getting closer to release/finished.</p>
<p>If any of your assets are used and I have not properly given credit, then please report an issue.</p>
