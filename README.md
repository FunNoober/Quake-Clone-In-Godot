# Quake-Clone-In-Godot
<p>Me experimenting with Quake like movement and weapons in the Godot Engine.</p>
<p>This is not designed to be a rip-off of the original Quake or any Quake game. I am only calling it Quake-Clone because I am stumped for a name and it plays a little like the Quake games.</p>
<p><b>Once I get futher close to release, I will change the name of this project to something more imaganative.</b></b>
